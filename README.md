### Abstract

"Abstract goes here..."

Folders include:

- **code**: The following Python files are included:
	-  Monte Carlo simulated Orthogonal Distance Regression (*orthogonal-distance-regression.py*)

	- Results of global and local Morans *I* spatial-autocorrelation (figures, summary statistics, and shapefiles)
- **figures**: Latest manuscript figures 
- **tables**: Latest manuscript tables, in .xls format
- **images**: Supplementary figures
- **manuscript**: Latest version of the above paper (pre-peer review)

### SHED-Earth

Our analytical approach (using Orthogonal Distance Regression) has now been implemented on SHED-Earth (http://shed.earth). Full code is available at: https://github.com/jonnyhuck/shed-earth
