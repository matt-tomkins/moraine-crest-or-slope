### Abstract

"Abstract goes here..."

Folders include:

- **code**: The following Python files are included:
	-  Monte Carlo simulated Orthogonal Distance Regression (*MC_Orthogonal_Distance_Regression.py*)
	-  Code for global and local Morans *I* spatial-autocorrelation
- **data**: Supplementary tables for <sup>10</sup>Be, <sup>36</sup>Cl and Schmidt hammer sampled boulders. Also included are:
	- Shapefiles representing the extents of the moraine sampling areas and associated Voronoi polygons
	- Input data for the Probabilistic Cosmogenic Age Analysis Tool (P-CAAT; Dortch *et al*. 2020) and output Matlab figures (.fig)
- **figures**: Latest manuscript figures 
- **images**: Supplementary figures
- **manuscript**: Latest version of the above paper (pre-peer review)

### SHED-Earth

Our analytical approach (using Orthogonal Distance Regression) has now been implemented on SHED-Earth (http://shed.earth). Full code is available at: https://github.com/jonnyhuck/shed-earth
