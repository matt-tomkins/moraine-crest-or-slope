### Abstract

"Abstract goes here..."

Folders include:

- **code**: The following Python files are included:
	-  Monte Carlo simulated Orthogonal Distance Regression (*MC_Orthogonal_Distance_Regression.py*)
	-  Code for Monte Carlo simulation of calibrated boulder exposure ages (*MC_Simulated_Ages.py*)

### SHED-Earth

Our analytical approach (using Orthogonal Distance Regression) has now been implemented on SHED-Earth (http://shed.earth). Full code is available at: https://github.com/jonnyhuck/shed-earth
