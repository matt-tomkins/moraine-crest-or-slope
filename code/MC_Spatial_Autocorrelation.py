# Loops through each landform

    # Loops through each simulated dataset (n = 1000)

        # Performs global Morans I

        # If simulated p is < 0.05, then significant. Record +1 for signif.

            # Perform local Morans I

            # Record the locations of significant clusters

        # else (p > 0.05), Record +1 for not signif.

At the end, we should have:

    (1) a record of the clustering frequency for each landform.
        number of significant datasets / 1000. Does the degree of clustering
        vary?

            Yes...

    (2) the locations of "good" and "bad" clusters. These can presented
        as a proportion of the total dataset. If one cell is identified
        as a cluster in 65 datasets, this would display as 6.5%.
        Another identified as a cluster in 782 datasets = 78.2%.

            Where are the clusters? On the crest or elsewhere?
