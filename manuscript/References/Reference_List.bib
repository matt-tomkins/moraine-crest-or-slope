For samples of basalt, sandstone and dolerite the maximum decrease in R-values is found between oven dry values and saturated rock rebound values, the magnitude of which varies from 2 to 10 points on the R-scale. A quartzite block has the greatest decline of 6 points at 60 per cent saturation. For certain rock types under differing site-to-site field moisture conditions the moisture effect can be a significant factor in the interpretation of the relative state of weathering from rebound values.

	abstract = {The cosmic ray flux increases at higher altitude as air pressure and the shielding effect of the atmosphere decrease. Altitude-dependent scaling factors are required to compensate for this effect in calculating cosmic ray exposure ages. Scaling factors in current use assume a uniform relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure over the Earth's surface. This masks regional differences in mean annual pressure and spatial variation in cosmogenic isotope production rates. Outside Antarctica, air pressures over land depart from the standard atmosphere by ±4.4 hPa (1σ) near sea level, corresponding to offsets of ±3?4\% in isotope production rates. Greater offsets occur in regions of persistent high and low pressure such as Siberia and Iceland, where conventional scaling factors predict production rates in error by ±10\%. The largest deviations occur over Antarctica where ground level pressures are 20?40 hPa lower than the standard atmosphere at all altitudes. Isotope production rates in Antarctica are therefore 25?30\% higher than values calculated by scaling Northern Hemisphere production rates with conventional scaling factors. Exposure ages of old Antarctic surfaces, especially those based on cosmogenic radionuclides at levels close to saturation, may be millions of years younger than published estimates.},

	abstract = {We have measured the concentration of in situ produced cosmogenic 
10Be and 26Al from bare bedrock surfaces on summit
flats in four western U.S. mountain ranges. The maximum mean
bare-bedrock erosion rate from these alpine environments is 7.6 ±
3.9 m My-1. Individual measurements vary between 2 and 19 m
My-1. These erosion rates are similar to previous cosmogenic
radionuclide (CRN) erosion rates measured in other environments, except
for those from extremely arid regions. This indicates that bare bedrock
is not weathered into transportable material more rapidly in alpine
environments than in other environments, even though frost weathering
should be intense in these areas. Our CRN-deduced point measurements of
bedrock erosion are slower than typical basin-averaged denudation rates
(˜ 50 m My-1). If our measured CRN erosion rates are
accurate indicators of the rate at which summit flats are lowered by
erosion, then relief in the mountain ranges examined here is probably
increasing. We develop a model of outcrop erosion to investigate the
magnitude of errors associated with applying the steady-state erosion
model to episodically eroding outcrops. Our simulations show that
interpreting measurements with the steady-state erosion model can yield
erosion rates which are either greater or less than the actual long-term
mean erosion rate. While errors resulting from episodic erosion are
potentially greater than both measurement and production rate errors for
single samples, the mean value of many steady-state erosion rate
measurements provides a much better estimate of the long-term erosion
rate.},

The oldest deposits sampled on Kilimanjaro yield a limiting 36Cl age of {\textgreater}360 calendar kyr (all 36Cl ages are in calendar years, cal. kyr or cal. yr). On Mount Kenya, the oldest moraines give ages of 355–420 kyr (Liki I) and 255–285 kyr (Teleki). Given the uncertainty in our 36Cl ages, the Liki I moraine may correspond to either marine isotope stage 10 or 12, whereas the Teleki moraine correlates with stage 8. There is no evidence for stage 6 on either mountain. The Liki II moraines on Mt. Kenya and moraines of the Fourth Glaciation on Kilimanjaro give ages of 28±3 kyr and 20±1 kyr, respectively. They represent the last glacial maximum (LGM) and correlate with stage 2 of the marine isotope record. A series of smaller moraines above the LGM deposits record several readvances that occurred during the late glacial. On Mt. Kenya, these deposits date to 14.6±1.2 kyr (Liki IIA), 10.2±0.5 kyr (Liki III), 8.6±0.2 kyr (Liki IIIA) and ∼200 yr (Lewis); the corresponding deposits on Kilimanjaro have mean ages of 17.3±2.9 kyr (Fourth Glaciation–Saddle), 15.8±2.5 kyr (Little Glaciation–Saddle), and 13.8±2.3 kyr (Fourth Glaciation–Kibo).

	abstract = {We used cosmogenic nuclide and geochemical mass balance methods to measure long-term rates of chemical weathering and total denudation in granitic landscapes in diverse climatic regimes. Our 42 study sites encompass widely varying climatic and erosional regimes, with mean annual temperatures ranging from 2 to 25 °C, average precipitation ranging from 22 to 420 cm·year−1, and denudation rates ranging from 23 to 755 t·km−2·year−1. Long-term chemical weathering rates range from 0 to 173 t·km−2 year−1, in several cases exceeding the highest granitic weathering rates on record from previous work. Chemical weathering rates are highest at the sites with rapid denudation rates, consistent with strong coupling between rates of chemical weathering and mineral supply from breakdown of rock. A simple empirical relationship based on temperature, precipitation and long-term denudation rates explains 89–95\% of the variation in long-term weathering rates across our network of sites. Our analysis shows that, for a given precipitation and temperature, chemical weathering rates increase proportionally with fresh-material supply rates. We refer to this as “supply-limited” weathering, in which fresh material is chemically depleted to roughly the same degree, regardless of its rate of supply from breakdown of rock. The temperature sensitivity of chemical weathering rates is two to four times smaller than what one would expect from laboratory measurements of activation energies for feldspar weathering and previous inter-comparisons of catchment mass-balance data from the field. Our results suggest that climate change feedbacks between temperature and silicate weathering rates may be weaker than previously thought, at least in actively eroding, unglaciated terrain similar to our study sites. To the extent that chemical weathering rates are supply-limited in mountainous landscapes, factors that regulate rates of mineral supply from erosion, such as tectonic uplift, may lead to significant fluctuations in global climate over the long term.},

	abstract = {An objective of terrestrial in situ cosmogenic nuclide research is to obtain precise and accurate production-rate estimates on the basis of geological calibration sites from a diverse range of latitudes and altitudes. However, a challenge has been to establish production rates on the basis of landforms for which independent ages have been determined directly using absolute isotopic dating techniques. Here we present a 10Be production-rate calibration from a recessional moraine belt located in Rannoch Moor, central Scottish Highlands (56.63°N, 4.77°W; ∼310–330 m a.s.l.). This moraine belt was deposited at the margin of the disintegrating late-glacial West Highland ice field (WHIF) during the final stages of deglaciation. Minimum-limiting 14C dates on macrofossils of the earliest terrestrial vegetation to arrive on the landscape place the timing of moraine abandonment, and hence exposure of morainal boulder surfaces to the cosmic-ray flux, to no later than 12,480 ± 100 calendar years before C.E. 1950 (cal yrs BP). Maximum-limiting 14C dates on marine shells incorporated into basal tills deposited during expansion of the WHIF to its full late-glacial extent place the onset of deglaciation, and thus deglaciation of Rannoch Moor, to no earlier than 12,700 ± 100 cal yrs BP. After removal of a single high-concentration outlier, surface 10Be concentrations of 11 boulders rooted in two sub-parallel moraine ridges exhibit a high degree of internal consistency and affords an arithmetic mean of 6.93 ± 0.24 [x104] atoms g−1 (1σ). This data set yields a site-specific 10Be production rate of 5.50 ± 0.18 at g−1 yr−1, based on the midpoint age 12,590 ± 140 cal yrs BP of the bracketing 14C chronology. Transforming this result to sea-level/high-latitude (SLHL) neutron-spallation 10Be production-rate values using Version 3 of the University of Washington (UW) Online Production-Rate Calculator yields upper and lower bounds, and a mid-point rate. Maximum-limiting SLHL 10Be production rates, based on minimum-limiting 14C age control, are 3.95 ± 0.11 (2.7\%) at g−1 yr−1 for the commonly used ‘Lm’ and ‘St’ scaling protocols. The corresponding (non-dimensional) correction factor for a reference production rate determined by the LSDn scaling model is 0.79 ± 0.02 (2.7\%). Minimum-limiting SLHL reference 10Be production rates, based on maximum-limiting 14C age control, are 3.88 ± 0.11 (2.7\%) at g−1 yr−1 (St) and 3.89 ± 0.11 (2.7\%) at g−1 yr−1 (Lm). The corresponding correction factor for LSDn scaling is 0.77 ± 0.02 (2.7\%). SLHL reference production-rate values based on a midpoint age of 12,590 ± 140 yrs are 3.91 ± 0.11 (2.8\%) at g−1 yr−1 (St) and 3.92 ± 0.11 (2.8\%) at g−1 yr−1 (Lm). The corresponding correction factor for LSDn scaling is 0.78 ± 0.02. The production-rate calibration data set presented here for Scotland yields SLHL values that agree with those determined from calibration data sets based on directly dated landforms from northeastern North America, the Arctic, the Swiss Alps, the Southern Hemisphere middle latitudes, and from the high tropical Andes. We suggest that this production-rate calibration data set from the central Scottish Highlands, used together with the UW online calculators, will produce accurate 10Be surface-exposure ages in the British Isles.},

A chronology has been obtained for glacial deposits at Bloody Canyon, California, by measurement ofthe accumulation of chlorine-36 produced by cosmic rays in boulders exposed on moraine crests. The accumulation ofchlorine-36 indicates that episodes of glaciation occurred at about 21, 24, 65, 115, 145, and 200 ka (thousand years ago). Although the timing of the glaciations correlates well with peaks of global ice volume inferred from the marine oxygen isotope record, the relative magnitudes differ markedly. The lengths of the moraines dating from 115 ka and 65 ka show that the early glacial episodes were more extensive than those during the later Wisconsin and indicate that the transition from interglacial to full glacial conditions was rapid.},

	abstract = {Periglacial trimlines separating glacially eroded lower slopes from blockfield-covered plateaus on British and Irish mountains have been interpreted either (1) in terms of representing the maximum altitude of the last ice sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), or (2) as a thermal boundary separating wet-based ice at pressure melting point from cold-based ice on summit plateaus. We test these competing hypotheses through 10Be exposure dating of high-level erratic boulders above trimlines on five mountains in NW Scotland. Nine out of 14 erratics yielded post-LGM exposure ages ranging from 14.0 ± 0.7 ka to 16.5 ± 0.9 ka or from 14.9 ± 0.9 ka to 17.6 ± 1.1 ka, depending on the 10Be production rate employed in exposure age calculation. These ages refute hypothesis (1) as they imply that the last ice sheet overtopped the mountains. Preservation of apparently intact blockfields on the summits implies cold-based ice cover, supporting hypothesis (2). As altitudinally consistent high-level trimlines extend from our sampled sites across much of NW Scotland and the Hebrides, our conclusions apply to all trimlines in this broader area, and probably to all high-level trimlines elsewhere in the British Isles. Preservation of blockfields under cold-based ice is consistent with blockfield evolution on plateaus throughout much or all of the Quaternary. Averaged exposure ages of ∼15–16 ka for plateau-top erratics implies nunatak emergence from the downwasting ice sheet prior to a regional readvance of the ice margin (the Wester Ross Readvance) and before rapid warming at ∼14.7 ka at the onset of the Lateglacial Interstade, but after the timing of ice-sheet thinning as retrodicted by recent proxy climate-driven thermo-mechanical coupled models. Our findings provide an additional constraint on the future development of such models by implying that high-level trimlines represent the altitude of a former transition zone between ice at pressure-melting point and ice below pressure melting point.},

The sampling strategy is based on the relative chronology provided by a detailed geomorphological map of glacial landforms. Results indicate that the last maximum ice advance occurred late (i.e., during Marine Isotope Stage 2) compared to the chronology currently established for the rest of the Pyrenees. Despite debatable evidence for a glacial readvance during the Oldest Dryas stade, ice-cap melt-out was rapid, residual cirque glaciers having disappeared by the Allerød interstade. This is consistent both with North Atlantic excursions established by the Greenland ice cores and paleoenvironmental data for the region. The rapid response of the east-Pyrenean ice cap to temperature variations is primarily linked to its small size compared to larger Pyrenean ice fields, to the dry Mediterranean climate, and to topography-related nonlinearities in which a small vertical rise in equilibrium line altitude generates a large change in ice mass. Possible sources of age uncertainty are discussed in the context of sampling design for single-nuclide (10Be) dating of landform sequences in formerly glaciated landscapes.},

In practice, this production rate parameter is set by calibration of the model using cosmogenic nuclide data from sites with independent age constraints. In this paper, we describe a calibration procedure developed during the Cosmic-Ray Produced Nuclide Systematics on Earth (CRONUS-Earth) project and its application to an extensive data set that included both new CRONUS-Earth samples and samples from previously published studies. We considered seven frameworks for elevation and latitude scaling and five commonly used cosmogenic nuclides, 3He, 10Be, 14C, 26Al, and 36Cl. In general, the results show that the calibrated production rates fail statistical tests of goodness-of-fit. One conclusion from the calibration results is that two newly developed scaling frameworks and the widely used Lal scaling framework provide qualitatively similar fits to the data, while neutron-monitor based scaling frameworks have much poorer fit to the data. To further test the fitted models, we computed site ages for a number of secondary sites not included in the primary calibration data set. The root-mean-square percent differences between the median computed ages for these secondary sites and independent ages range from 7.1\% to 27.1\%, differences that are much larger than the typical uncertainties in the site ages. The results indicate that there are substantial unresolved difficulties in modeling cosmogenic nuclide production and the calibration of production rates.},

	abstract = {Ice-marginal moraines are often used to reconstruct the dimensions of former ice masses, which are then used as proxies for palaeoclimate. This approach relies on the assumption that the distribution of moraines in the modern landscape is an accurate reflection of former ice margin positions during climatically controlled periods of ice margin stability. However, the validity of this assumption is open to question, as a number of additional, nonclimatic factors are known to influence moraine distribution. This review considers the role played by topography in this process, with specific focus on moraine formation, preservation, and ease of identification (topoclimatic controls are not considered). Published literature indicates that the importance of topography in regulating moraine distribution varies spatially, temporally, and as a function of the ice mass type responsible for moraine deposition. In particular, in the case of ice sheets and ice caps ({\textgreater}1000km2), one potentially important topographic control on where in a landscape moraines are deposited is erosional feedback, whereby subglacial erosion causes ice masses to become less extensive over successive glacial cycles. For the marine-terminating outlets of such ice masses, fjord geometry also exerts a strong control on where moraines are deposited, promoting their deposition in proximity to valley narrowings, bends, bifurcations, where basins are shallow, and/or in the vicinity of topographic bumps. Moraines formed at the margins of ice sheets and ice caps are likely to be large and readily identifiable in the modern landscape. In the case of icefields and valley glaciers (10–1000km2), erosional feedback may well play some role in regulating where moraines are deposited, but other factors, including variations in accumulation area topography and the propensity for moraines to form at topographic pinning points, are also likely to be important. This is particularly relevant where land-terminating glaciers extend into piedmont zones (unconfined plains, adjacent to mountain ranges) where large and readily identifiable moraines can be deposited. In the case of cirque glaciers ({\textless}10km2), erosional feedback is less important, but factors such as topographic controls on the accumulation of redistributed snow and ice and the availability of surface debris, regulate glacier dimensions and thereby determine where moraines are deposited. In such cases, moraines are likely to be small and particularly susceptible to post-depositional modification, sometimes making them difficult to identify in the modern landscape. Based on this review, we suggest that, despite often being difficult to identify, quantify, and mitigate, topographic controls on moraine distribution should be explicitly considered when reconstructing the dimensions of palaeoglaciers and that moraines should be judiciously chosen before being used as indirect proxies for palaeoclimate (i.e., palaeoclimatic inferences should only be drawn from moraines when topographic controls on moraine distribution are considered insignificant).},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTThe temporal pattern of rock-slope failures (RSFs) following Late Pleistocene deglaciation on tectonically stable terrains is controversial: previous studies variously suggest (1) a rapid response due to removal of supporting ice (‘debuttressing’), (2) a progressive decline in RSF frequency, and (3) a millennial-scale delay before peak RSF activity. We test these competing models through beryllium-10 (10Be) exposure dating of five closely-spaced quartzite RSFs on the Isle of Jura, Scotland, to establish the relationship between timing of failure and those of deglaciation, episodes of rapid warming and periods of rapid glacio-isostatic uplift. All five dated RSFs occurred at least 720–2240 years after deglaciation, with the probability of failure peaking 2 ka after deglaciation, consistent with millennial-scale delay model (3). This excludes debuttressing as an immediate cause of failure, though it is likely that time-dependent stress release due to deglacial unloading resulted in progressive development of failure planes within the rock. Thaw of permafrost ice in joints is unlikely to have been a prime trigger of failure as some RSFs occurred several centuries after the onset of interstadial warming. Conversely, the timespan of the RSFs coincides with the period of maximum glacio-isostatic crustal uplift, suggesting that failure was triggered by uplift-driven seismic events acting on fractured rock masses. Implications of this and related research are: (1) that retreat of the last Pleistocene ice sheets across tectonically-stable mountainous terrains was succeeded by a period of enhanced rock-slope failure due to deglacial unloading and probably uplift-driven seismicity; (2) that the great majority of RSFs in the British Isles outside the limits of Loch Lomond Stadial (= Younger Dryas) glaciation are of Lateglacial (pre-Holocene) age; and (3) numerous RSFs must also have occurred inside Loch Lomond Stadial (LLS) glacial limits, but that runout debris was removed by LLS glaciers.

However, a number of issues such as hammer type, normalization of rebound values, specimen dimensions, surface smoothness, weathering and moisture content, and testing, data reduction and analysis procedures continue to influence the consistency and reliability of the Schmidt hammer test results. This paper presents: a) a critical review of these basic issues; and b) the results of tests conducted on granitic rocks of various weathering grades in the light of the conclusions of this review. It was found that a very good correlation exists between L and N hammer rebound values and that both hammers are fairly sensitive to the physical properties, particularly to dry density though less so to effective and total porosities. The N hammer, producing a lesser scatter in the data, proved to be more efficient than the L hammer in predicting uniaxial compressive strength and Young's modulus. The exponential form of the correlation curves was found to reflect microstructural changes during the course of weathering and the differences in the probing scales or mechanisms in the means of measuring these mechanical properties, and could be generalized to other crystalline igneous rocks. The possibility of predicting weathering grades from rebound values was also explored. The changes in the rebound values during multiple impacts at a given point produced a better indication of the weathering grade than a single impact value. It was concluded that increasing the impact energy and plunger tip diameter should significantly reduce the scatter in coarse-grained weathered rocks and hence improve the reliability of the Schmidt hammer as a rock material characterization tool.},

Here, we present a method for extracting this information by fitting geomorphic process models to observed exposure ages from single moraines. We also apply this method to 94 10Be apparent exposure ages from 11 moraines reported in four published studies. Our models represent 10Be accumulation in boulders that are exhumed over time by slope processes (moraine degradation), and the delivery of boulders with preexisting 10Be inventories to moraines (inheritance). For now, we neglect boulder erosion and snow cover, which are likely second-order processes. Given a highly scattered data set, we establish which model yields the better fit to the data, and estimate the age of the moraine from the better model fit. The process represented by the better-fitting model is probably responsible for most of the scatter among the apparent ages. Our methods should help resolve controversies in exposure dating; we reexamine the conclusions from two published studies based on our model fits.},

	abstract = {A compilation and a critical assessment of the 14C data set available show that the chronology of glacial events in the Pyrenees is not well constrained. After reviewing the literature on glacial reconstruction, we suggest a simplified subdivision of the Pyrenean last glacial cycle record into Last Pleniglacial, Deglaciation, and Neoglacial. To improve the numerical glacial chronology, we provide 10Be surface exposure ages for 5 glacial erosion surfaces, 9 moraines and 2 erratics in the Upper Noguera Ribagorçana Valley (south-central Pyrenees). Published corrected 14C data and new 10Be exposure ages indicate that the major phase of moraine building recorded in this valley during the Last Pleniglacial probably occurred after 25kaBP. This age calls in question the generally accepted hypothesis of a very early deglaciation of the Pyrenees ca 70–40kaBP, and strongly suggests that the Pyrenees could have been in pleniglacial conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, we do not exclude the possibility that the maximum glacier extent during the last glacial cycle had taken place much earlier than the LGM, as indicated by some published U-Th, AMS 14C and OSL data. We suggest that pleniglacial conditions could have taken place during a longer (⪢30–20ka) period than generally assumed, and that the Last Pleniglacial could include several glacier fluctuations recorded irregularly in different valleys, with a last major glacier readvance taking place around the LGM. In addition, the Deglaciation is represented by a series of moraines deposited between ca 13.7±0.9 and 10.1±0.6ka. This moraine series indicates a highly variable climatic pattern that is partly correlated with Greenland Stadial 1 (the Younger Dryas), and suggests that the Deglaciation could have continued into the early Holocene.},

	abstract = {This paper examines glacial evolution in the La Pera and Malniu cirques, and Arànser, La Llosa and Duran valleys, in the Cerdanya massifs on the south-facing slopes of the eastern Pyrenees. A geomorphologic analysis and dating of moraine boulders, glacially polished bedrock and rock glacier blocks were carried out by means of cosmogenic 36Cl surface exposure dating. The maximum ice advance was contemporary with the Last Glacial Maximum at 23ka ago, and it was of greater or only slightly lesser magnitude than for previous Quaternary advances. The termini of glaciers remained close to maximum positions, with minor advances and retreats until 18–17ka when the glacial tongues disappeared from the valleys. Depending on the previous topography, these glaciers left behind a single polygenic moraine, in the case of confined valleys, or multiple moraines next to each other in the case of flat, more open areas. A final glacial advance is detected during the Oldest Dryas close to the cirque headwalls, and the glaciers finally disappeared during the Bølling interstadial. The glaciers were then replaced by rock glaciers, whose front immediately became inactive, although their activity continued near their source area until the early Holocene.},

	abstract = {We have studied the concentrations of 10Be and 26Al in quartz crystals extracted from glacially polished granitic surfaces from the Sierra Nevada range. These surfaces were identified with the glacial advance during the Tioga period ∼11,000 years ago. Our measurements yield the most accurate estimates to date for the absolute production rates of these nuclides in SiO2 due to cosmic ray nucleons and muons for geomagnetic latitudes 43.8°–44.6°N and altitudes 2.1–3.6 km. The estimates are relatively free from uncertainties in snow cover since we studied a suite of rock surfaces inclined 0°–75° with respect to the horizontal. The principal uncertainty arises due to the lack of a precise date for the glacial retreat event, about ±10\%. The 26Al/10Be ratio at production (6.0) is determined more accurately since the exposure age of the samples is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the mean lives of the two nuclides. Production rates of 10Be and 26Al in quartz at other latitudes and altitudes in the troposphere can be determined from the present measurements by scaling, using the known altitude and latitude dependence of cosmic ray fluxes of nucleons and negative muons. Knowledge of the production rates of these nuclides is a prerequisite for their application in erosion and geomorphological studies.},

	abstract = {The Schmidt hammer is a useful tool applied by geomorphologists to measure rock strength in field conditions. The essence of field application is to obtain a sufficiently large dataset of individual rebound values, which yields a meaningful numerical value of mean strength. Although there is general agreement that a certain minimum sample size is required to proceed with the statistics, the choice of size (i.e. number of individual impacts) was usually intuitive and arbitrary. In this paper we show a simple statistical method, based on the two-sample Student's t-test, to objectively estimate the minimum number of rebound measurements. We present the results as (1) the ‘mean’ and ‘median’ solutions, each providing a single estimate value, and (2) the empirical probability distribution of such estimates based on many field samples. Schmidt hammer data for 14 lithologies, 13–81 samples for each, with each sample consisting of 40 individual readings, have been evaluated, assuming different significance levels. The principal recommendations are: (1) the recommended minimum sample size for weak and moderately strong rock is 25; (2) a sample size of 15 is sufficient for sandstones and shales; (3) strong and coarse rocks require 30 readings at a site; (4) the minimum sample size may be reduced by one-third if the context of research allows for higher significance level for test statistics. Interpretations based on less than 10 readings from a site should definitely be avoided. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {.The endolithic lichen Lecidea auriculata is known to enhance rock surface weathering on the Little Ice Age moraines of the glacier Storbreen in Jotunheimen, central southern Norway. This study demonstrates the reduction in Schmidt hammer Rvalues that followed the rapid colonization by this lichen of pyroxene‐granulite boulders on terrain deglaciated over the last 88 years. In the absence of this lichen, the characteristic mean R‐value of boulder surfaces is 61.0 ± 0.3; where this lichen is present, R‐values are lower by at least 20 units on surfaces exposed for 30–40 years. A similar reduction in rock hardness on rock surfaces without a lichen cover requires about 10 ka. The rapid initial weakening of the rock surfaces is indicative of rates of biological weathering by endolithic lichens that may be two orders of magnitude (200–300 times) faster than rates of physico‐chemical weathering alone. If not avoided, the effects of this type of lichen are likely to negate the effectiveness of the Schmidt hammer and other methods for exposure‐age dating, including cosmogenic‐nuclide dating, in severe alpine and polar periglacial environments. The results also suggest a new method for dating rock surfaces exposed for {\textless}50 years.},

Minimal chemical weathering makes Antarctica an ideal location in which to compare the physical weathering of carbonate rocks to other lithologies. Here we report the first cosmogenic nuclide-derived erosion rates for carbonate rocks in Antarctica. Carbonate samples collected in the southernmost Ellsworth Mountains reflect a 36Cl erosion rate of 0.22 ± 0.02 mm/ka. This erosion rate is consistent with other reported Antarctic erosion rates, but is lower than 36Cl erosion rates derived from other arid regions in the world. These results are integrated with a continent-wide reanalysis of 28 cosmogenic nuclide erosion rate studies ({\textgreater}200 measurements), which comprise numerous rock types and multiple cosmogenic nuclides. By combining cosmogenic nuclide-derived erosion rates across studies, the larger trends provide insight into factors (e.g. lithology, glacial history, and availability of abrasive material) affecting subaerial erosion rates in Antarctica. Statistical analysis of the compiled data set shows differences based on lithology, with sandstone having the largest range of erosion rates. The compiled data also reveals higher erosion rates in areas with a large potential sediment supply, like the Dry Valleys. Samples collected from boulders yield lower erosion rates than those collected from bedrock, likely due to a combination of physical processes that affect boulders and bedrock differently, and glacial history, which can affect the apparent cosmogenic-nuclide derived erosion rate.},

The ages obtained from glacial deposits indicate glacial periods at 85±5 ka, 64±11 ka, and 36±3 ka (from glacial till) and 20±3 ka (from loess). The fluvial drainage system, fed by glaciers in the headwaters, developed extensive terrace systems in the Cinca River valley at 178±21 ka, 97±16 ka, 61±4 ka, 47±4 ka, and 11±1 ka, and in the Gállego River valley at 151±11 ka, 68±7 ka, and 45±3 ka. The times of maximum geomorphic activity related to cold phases coincide with Late Pleistocene marine isotope stages and Heinrich events. The maximum extent of glaciers during the last glacial occurred at 64±11 ka, and the terraces correlated with this glacial phase are the most extensive in both the Cinca (61±4 ka) and Gállego (68±7 ka) valleys, indicating a strong increase in fluvial discharge and availability of sediments related to the transition to deglaciation. The global Last Glacial Maximum is scarcely represented in the south central Pyrenees owing to dominantly dry conditions at that time. Precipitation must be controlled by the position of the Iberian Peninsula with respect to the North Atlantic atmospheric circulation system. The glacial systems and the associated fluvial dynamic seem sensitive to 1) global climate changes controlled by insolation, 2) North Atlantic thermohaline circulation influenced by freshwater pulses into the North Atlantic, and 3) anomalies in atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic controlling precipitation on the Iberian Peninsula. Our scenario of glacial and fluvial evolution during the Late Pleistocene in northern Spain could be extrapolated to other glaciated mountainous areas in southern Europe.},

	abstract = {A number of in situ cosmogenic radionuclides and stable nuclides have been measured in natural exposed rock surfaces with a view to study their in situ production and rock erosion rates [1]. The in situ radionuclides can be used for a high-resolution tomography of the erosional history of an exposed surface; two stable nuclides (3He, 21Ne) and five radionuclides (10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, 14C, 39Ar) having half-lives in the range of ∼ 300-1.5 × 106 yr half-life are measurable in many rock types. A prerequisite for the application of the in situ nuclides for the study of erosional histories of surfaces is a knowledge of their production rates under different irradiation conditions; altitude, latitude, irradiation geometry and shielding. Relative nuclide production rates can be determined fairly accurately using the extensive available data on cosmic ray neutrons [2]. Absolute nuclide production rates cannot generally be predicted with any accuracy because of lack of data on excitation functions of nuclides unless some normalization is possible, as was done in the case of several cosmic ray produced isotopes in the atmosphere [3]. Based on a recent natural calibration experiment in which erosion free surfaces exposed to cosmic radiation for ∼ 11,000 yrs were sampled, the absolute production rates of 10Be and 26Al in quartz have been accurately estimated for mountain altitudes in Sierra Nevada [4]. The absolute production rates of 10Be and 26Al in quartz can therefore be estimated fairly accurately for any given latitude and altitude. Some measurements of 14C in rocks of low erosion rate [5] similarly allow an estimate of its production rate. Attempts made to measure the in situ production rates of 3He in rocks have not yet led to a convergent production rate. In view of the importance of knowing the production rates of isotopes of He, Ne and Ar, I present here theoretical estimates of their production rates based on available cross-section data. I discuss the information that can be extracted from the study of the in situ nuclides in rocks. Useful parameters characterizing the exposure history of a rock surface are: (1) the effective surface exposure age; and (2) the time-averaged erosion rate. The implications of these parameters for single and multiple nuclide studies are discussed in terms of the erosion models considered.},

In situ10 Be concentrations in granites on Corsica (Mediterranean), exposed to subalpine climate, yield weathering rates of between 9 and 20 mm ka−1, when averaged over the last 30–100 ka. Weathering rates rise with increasing precipitation and brittle deformation. Thermal history modelling of apatite fission-track (AFT) data confirms that average denudation rates of 5–20 mm ka−1 were typical during the Neogene. Short- and long-term denudation rates are in the same range and indicate that a late Neogene global increase in denudation rates has probably not affected geomorphically stable uplifted palaeosurfaces of hilly to low mountainous local relief. A Southwards decrease in short- and long-term denudation rates indicate a linear relationship with decreasing precipitation. Post-glacial downwearing of moraine matrix, as constrained by soil-derived humic etching of dated glacial boulders, yields 40–140 mm ka−1, which indicates a poor preservation potential of moraines older than the last glaciation. This weathering rate is of the order of 3 times faster than that found for long-term regolith formation from granites based on of geomorphic evidence.},

Chemical erosion dominates even at elevations around 2,000 m in presently subalpine climate conditions. Field evidence indicates that erosion operates by continuous dissolution and/or disintegration to grains (grusification). The erosion rates are relatively high with respect to the preservation of inferred Early Miocene landscapes. We infer temporal burial in the Middle Miocene and significantly lower erosion rates in the Neogene until ∼3 Ma to explain the preservation of paleosurfaces, in line with fission track data. Valley incision rates that are a magnitude higher than erosion rates on summit surfaces result in relief enhancement and long-term isostatic surface uplift. On the other hand, widening and deepening of valleys by cyclic glaciation progressively destroys the summit surface relics.},

The BIS is an effective analogue for contemporary glacial systems but our understanding of its retreat under changing climate conditions is constrained by a limited number of dates obtained from existing methods (14C, OSL). These methods are restricted in their application to glacial environments and while TCND has addressed this to some degree, its cost and potential for outliers encourage the establishment of new techniques. SHED fulfils this requirement by providing a cost-efficient method for obtaining numerous direct ages that are of comparable accuracy and precision to TCND. A multi-lithology approach has established that many rock types are unsuitable for numerical dating. However, a robust calibration curve was generated (R2 = 0.81, p = {\textless} 0.01) for granite surfaces and applied to 31 undated granite erratics on Shap Fell, NW England. SHED indicates that BIS retreat occurred at 16.5 ± 0.5 ka, a conclusion which supports our current understanding of regional deglaciation and indicates that SHED can be a valuable and cost-effective geochronological tool.},

	abstract = {Surface exposure dating is a new, but already widely used tool in geomorphological studies, aiming, e.g. at the establishment of glacial chronologies. Sometimes, however, results from samples taken from one and the same moraine scatter widely and thus interpretation turns out to be difficult. Here we assess sample-specific effects (topographic shielding, sample geometry and erosion) on 17 surface exposure ages obtained by analysis of in situ produced cosmogenic 10Be in boulders from moraines in the Pamir Mountains (Tajikistan). A wide scatter of exposure ages is observed only for hummocky moraines ({\textgreater}45 to 10 ka BP), but not for distinct lateral moraines (∼20 and 60 ka BP, respectively). It is hypothesized that inheritance (prior exposure) and moraine degradation may be responsible for the wide scatter of exposure ages on the hummocky moraines. To proof this hypothesis, a data set of 72 boulders from the Pamir Mountains is used. We conclude that most likely hummocky moraines experienced long-lasting landform surface instability, probably due to buried glacier ice that is protected from melting several ten thousand years by a thick debris cover.},

	abstract = {Rapid, field-based measurements of rock hardness are of use in investigating many geomorphological and heritage science problems. Several different methods are now available for taking such measurements, but little work has been done to assess their comparability and strengths and weaknesses. We review here the capabilities of two types of Schmidt Hammer (Classic N type and Silver Schmidt BL type) alongside two types of Equotip (standard type D and Piccolo) for investigating rock hardness in relation to rock weathering on various types of sandstone and limestone, as well as basalt and dolerite. Whilst the two Schmidt hammers and the two Equotips show comparable results when tested at 15 individual sites, interesting differences are found between the Equotip and Schmidt Hammer values which may reveal information about the nature of weathering on different surfaces. Operator variance is shown to be an issue in particular for the Equotip devices, which also exhibit higher variability in measurements and necessitate larger sample sizes. Carborundum pre-treatment also has varying effects on the data collected, depending on the nature of the surface studied. The Equotip devices are shown to be particularly useful on smaller blocks and in situations where edge effects may affect Schmidt Hammer readings. We conclude that whilst each device contributes to geomorphological research, they do not necessarily produce comparable information. Indeed, using Schmidt Hammer and Equotip in combination and looking at any differences in results may provide invaluable insights into the structure of the near-surface zones and the nature of weathering processes.

	abstract = {Recent research has established Schmidt Hammer exposure dating (SHED) as an effective method for dating glacial landforms in the UK. This paper presents new data and discussion to clarify and to evaluate calibration procedures. These make a distinction between Schmidt Hammer drift following use (instrument calibration), and variation between both individual Schmidt Hammers and between user strategies when utilising age-calibration curves (age calibration). We show that while test anvil methods are useful for verifying that Schmidt Hammers maintain their standard R-values, they are inappropriate for instrument calibration except for the hardest natural rock surfaces (R-values: ≥ 70). A range of surfaces were tested using 3 N-Type Schmidt Hammers, which showed that existing anvil calibration procedures led to consistent overestimation of R-values by up to 17.9\%. In contrast, new calibration procedures, which are based on the use of a calibration point which lies within the range of R-values measured in the field [Dortch et al. 2016, Quat. Geochron., 35, 67–68], limit variance to maximum of 4.4\% for surfaces typically tested by Quaternary researchers (R-values: 25–60). Moreover, these new calibration procedures are more appropriate for age calibration as they incorporate operator variance through choice of sampling location. New calibration procedures are used to compile an updated age-calibration curve based upon 54 granite surfaces (R2 = 0.94, p {\textless} .01) from across Scotland, NW England and Ireland. The inclusion of a further 29 terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure ages extends the calibration period to 0.8–23.8 ka, covering the entire post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) history of the British-Irish Ice Sheet. To facilitate comparison between studies, an online calculator is made available at http://shed.earth for Schmidt Hammer instrument and age calibration and SHED exposure age calculation. The SHED-Earth calculator provides a rapid and accessible means of exposure age calculation to encourage wider and more consistent application of SHED throughout the British Isles.},

This paper presents 27 36Cl terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages from glacial boulders on Mount Tymphi (2497 m a.s.l., 40oN) in Epirus, northwest Greece. These ages address both a significant geographical gap in Mediterranean glacial chronologies and a temporal gap in the glacial history of this region by targeting the previously undated Late Pleistocene record. Late Pleistocene glaciers were restricted to the cirques and upper valleys of Mount Tymphi. Terminal and lateral moraines between 1700 m and 2050 m a.s.l. mark the extent of Late Pleistocene glaciers on the southern side of Mount Tymphi. Moraines marking the maximum extent of Late Pleistocene glaciation date to 29.0 ± 3.0 ka and 25.7 ± 2.6 ka, taking the oldest ages as most representative of moraine emplacement. Glaciers had retreated to the high cirques by 24.5 ± 2.4 ka during Heinrich Stadial 2. Rock glaciers formed under cold and drier conditions during this period of glacier retreat. This 36Cl dataset complements published U-series ages from secondary calcites in glacial sediments below 1700 m elevation, which demonstrate more extensive Middle Pleistocene glaciations in MIS 6 and MIS 12. A Late Pleistocene glacier maxima on Mount Tymphi at 25.7–29 ka is in good agreement with well-preserved outwash sediments dating to 24–28 ka in the Voidomatis River record downstream and is consistent with the Ioaninna basin pollen record indicating cool and wet conditions, most favourable for glacier growth, at 25–30 ka.},

	abstract = {If radiocarbon measurements are to be used at all for chronological purposes, we have to use statistical methods for calibration. The most widely used method of calibration can be seen as a simple application of Bayesian statistics, which uses both the information from the new measurement and information from the 14C calibration curve. In most dating applications, however, we have larger numbers of 14C measurements and we wish to relate those to events in the past. Bayesian statistics provides a coherent framework in which such analysis can be performed and is becoming a core element in many 14C dating projects. This article gives an overview of the main model components used in chronological analysis, their mathematical formulation, and examples of how such analyses can be performed using the latest version of the OxCal software (v4). Many such models can be put together, in a modular fashion, from simple elements, with defined constraints and groupings. In other cases, the commonly used “uniform phase” models might not be appropriate, and ramped, exponential, or normal distributions of events might be more useful. When considering analyses of these kinds, it is useful to be able run simulations on synthetic data. Methods for performing such tests are discussed here along with other methods of diagnosing possible problems with statistical models of this kind.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of 10Be (t12 = 1.5 × 106 y) and 26A1 (t12 = 0.72 × 106 y) have been determined by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) in a suite of quartz samples taken from sandstone boulders in several moraines in Arena Valley, a dry valley adjacent to the Taylor Glacier in the Quatermain Mountains, Southern Victoria Land, East Antarctica. These isotopes are produced in surficial quartz by cosmic ray spallation of O and Si. The concentrations in these samples ranged from 6.1 × 105 to 3.0 × 107 at g−1 for 10Be and from 9.4 × 106 to 1.2 × 108 at g−1 for 26A1, depending upon the extent of exposure at the surface. Analyses of 10Be in several samples from a single moraine at altitudes ranging from 1300 to 1650 m permitted an estimation of the air attenuation pathlength of cosmic ray neutrons; the value of 142+96−41 g cm−2 is consistent with other published values. Production rates of 17+6−4 at g−1 y−1 for 10Be and 113+54−16 at g−1 y−1 for 26A1 at 1300 m and 87°S and a 26Al: 10Be production ratio of 6.5+1.3−1.3 were calculated from the data. These values correspond to sea-level production rates at high geomagnetic latitude of 6.4 at g−1 y−1 and 41.7 at g−1 y−1 for 10Be and 26A1, respectively, consistent with determinations based on {\textasciitilde} 11 Ky glacially polished surfaces in the Sierra Nevada in California. These production rates imply exposure ages for the various moraines ranging from 50 Ky to 2.5 My, in accordance with other geological evidence. The 10Be and 26Al ages of these rocks compare favorably with those found using a similar dating method based on in situ production of 3He. Examination of the 3He concentrations in conjunction with the present data set yields an estimate of 3He production of 230+8540 at g−1 y−1, corresponding to 85+31−15 at g−1 y−1 at sea level. This is lower than previously reported values of 240 ± 60 at g−1 y−1 and {\textasciitilde}190 at g−1 y−1 (scaled to sea-level and high geomagnetic latitude) based, respectively, on volcanic flows less than 2000 years old at low latitude, and samples collected from 14,400-year-old volcanic flows. This discrepancy is likely due to diffusive losses which may become significant (up to {\textasciitilde}50\%) for surface exposure ages on the order of 2.0 My. Nevertheless, the general correlations among the three isotopes suggest that 3He does not suffer gross losses through diffusion.},

We also present the new results of an extension to this study. Finally we discuss the use of the asymptotic covariance matrix for computing confidence regions and intervals for the estimated parameters.

	abstract = {Cirques are emblematic landforms of alpine landscapes. The statistical distribution of cirque-floor elevations is used to infer glacial equilibrium-line altitude, and the age of their frontal moraines for reconstructing glacial chronologies. Very few studies, however, have sought to measure cirque-floor and supraglacial ridgetop bedrock downwearing rates in order to confront these denudation estimates with theoretical models of Quaternary mountain landscape evolution. Here we use 10Be nuclide samples (n=36) from moraines, bedrock steps, and supraglacial ridgetops among a population of cirques in the east-central Pyrenees in order to quantify denudation in the landscape and detect whether the mountain topography bears any relevance to the glacial buzzsaw hypothesis. Minimum exposure ages (MEAs) obtained for a succession of moraines spanning the Oldest Dryas to the Holocene produced a deglaciation chronology for three different Pyrenean ranges: Maladeta, Bassiès, and Carlit. Based on a series of corrections, calibrations, and chronostratigraphic tuning procedures, MEAs on ice-polished bedrock exposures were further used to model denudation depths at nested timescales during the Würm, the Younger Dryas, and the Holocene. Results show that subglacial cirque-floor denudation was lower during glacial periods (Würm: {\textasciitilde}10mm/ka) than during deglacial and interglacial periods (tens to hundreds of mm/ka). The relative inefficiency of glacial denudation in the cirque zone during the Würm would have resulted from (i) cold-based and/or (ii) low-gradient glaciers situated in the upper reaches of the icefield; and/or from (iii) glacier-load starvation because of arrested clast supply from supraglacial rockslopes situated in the permafrost zone. Denudation peaked during the Younger Dryas and Holocene glacial advances, a time when cirque glaciers became steeper, warmer-based, and when frost cracking weakened supraglacial ridgetops, thus enhancing subglacial erosion by providing debris to the sliding glacier base. Cirques, therefore, grow faster during more temperate periods of cirque glaciation than under full glacial conditions. Another key finding was the very low rates of ridgetop lowering averaged over the Würm and Holocene (10–25mm/ka). A comparison of the denudation rates obtained from the cirque zone with regional estimates of crustal uplift indicates that the alpine topography is not in a steady state. The low intensity of glacial denudation failed to bring the topography to a buzzsaw equilibrium state.},

	abstract = {The increased detection sensitivity offered by AMS has dramatically expanded the utility of 10Be. As these applications become more sophisticated attention has focused on the accuracy of the 10Be standards used to calibrate the AMS measurements. In recent years it has become apparent that there is a discrepancy between two of the most widely used 10Be AMS standards, the ICN 10Be standard and the NIST 10Be standard. The ICN (ICN Chemical \& Radioisotope Division) 10Be AMS standard was calibrated by radioactive decay counting. Dilutions, ranging from 5×10−13 to 3×10−11 10Be/Be, have been prepared and are extensively used in many AMS laboratories. The NIST 10Be standard, prepared at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is calibrated by mass spectrometric isotope ratio measurements. To provide an independent calibration of the 10Be standards we implanted a known number of 10Be atoms in both Si detectors and Be foil targets. The 10Be concentrations in these targets were measured by AMS. The results were compared with both the ICN and NIST AMS standards. Our 10Be measurements indicate that the 10Be/9Be isotopic ratio of the ICN AMS standard, which is based on a 10Be half-life of 1.5×106yr, is 1.106±0.012 times lower than the nominal value. Since the decay rate of the ICN standard is well determined, the decrease in 10Be/9Be ratio requires that the 10Be half-life be reduced to (1.36±0.07)×106yr. The quoted uncertainty includes a ±5\% uncertainty in the activity measurement carried out by ICN. In a similar fashion, we determined that the value of the NIST 10Be standard (SRM4325) is (2.79±0.03)×10−11 10Be/9Be, within error of the certified value of (2.68±0.14)×10−11. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) internal standards were also included in this study. We conclude that the 9Be(n,γ) neutron cross section is 7.8±0.23mb, without taking into account the uncertainty in the neutron irradiation.},

	abstract = {The only glaciers existing today in the Iberian Peninsula are small features located in the Pyrenees, though their number and extension has undergone significant changes over the Late Quaternary. The wide range of glacial landforms and deposits distributed across different Iberian ranges suggests the occurrence of several past periods with larger glacial systems. The objective of this research is to summarize the current knowledge on the spatial and temporal patterns of glacial activity in the Iberian mountains during the Late Quaternary. To this purpose, the chronological framework was divided in six periods: glaciations prior to the Last Glacial Cycle (Middle Pleistocene), Last Glacial Cycle (Late Pleistocene), Termination-1, Holocene, Little Ice Age (LIA) and present-day. The data were geographically divided considering the mountain systems where glacial evidence exists: Pyrenees, Cantabrian Range, NW ranges, Central Range, Iberian Range and Sierra Nevada. During Quaternary cold stages, ice accumulated in the head valleys of these mountain ranges and glaciers flowed down-valleys. In all cases, glaciers remained confined within the mountain systems and did not reach the surrounding lowlands. Depending on the combination of temperatures and moisture conditions, more or less ice was stored. In some ranges, there is evidence of Middle Pleistocene glaciations, one potentially correlating with marine isotope stage (MIS) 12 and another correlating with MIS 6 with glaciation dated to ca. 130-170 ka. However, most of the glacial records correspond to the Last Glacial Cycle and subsequent Termination. The maximum glacial expansion of this last Pleistocene glaciation stage occurred well before the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) between 30 and 60 ka in the Cantabrian Mountains and Pyrenees, at ca. 30 ka in Sierra Nevada and NW ranges, and (almost) synchronously to the LGM in the Central Range and Iberian Range. A massive glacial retreat occurred in all ranges at 19-20 ka, but the long-term deglaciation process was interrupted by cold intervals, such as the Oldest and Younger Dryas, which favoured glacial expansion in the highest mountains. Temperature increase recorded during the Holocene conditioned the melting of glaciers, which only reappeared in the highest massifs during the coldest periods, such as the LIA. However, post-LIA warming led to glacier disappearance in the Cantabrian Mountains, Sierra Nevada and most massifs of the Pyrenees, together with an accelerated shrinkage of the small glaciers still existing in this range at elevations near 3000 m.},

	abstract = {As part of the NSF-funded program CRONUS-Earth, a series of natural reference materials for in situ produced 26Al, 10Be, 14C, and 36Cl were prepared and circulated to United States, Australian, and European laboratories for analysis to explore the comparability of results from the different laboratories and generate preliminary consensus values for a range of reference material. Such reference materials, which did not exist for these isotopes, assist laboratories in independently assessing quality and are useful to quantify precision and accuracy. Currently, most researchers report only internal analytical uncertainties for all results. While researchers have acknowledged the need for realistic inter-laboratory uncertainties for in situ produced cosmogenic isotopes, few previous studies have addressed this issue. Two samples (denoted A and N) were provided for 26Al, 10Be and in situ 14C analysis, one from the Antarctic, high in 26Al and 10Be and the other from Australia, lower in both 26Al and 10Be. Both samples were prepared to quartz at the University of Vermont. For each sample, results have been summarised in terms of the mean reported concentration, standard deviation both between (inter) and within (intra) laboratories to describe inter- and intra-laboratory variability. Coefficients of variation (CoV) expressed as a percentage of the mean are also reported. For in-situ 14C, a small number of laboratories reported results, so they are summarised separately. Initial uncorrected results for 10Be for samples A and N showed significant variation (greater than 8\% CoV) in results. When corrected to a common standardisation basis, the CoV was 2.9\% for 10Be measurements of sample A (high concentration) and to 4.1\% for sample N (lower concentration), which is closer to typical cosmogenic samples. 26Al measurements had greater variation; a CoV of 4.9\% was achieved for sample A (high concentration) but for the lower concentration sample N, the CoV was 10.1\%.},

	abstract = {Erratic boulder trains (EBTs) are a useful glacial geomorphological feature because they reveal former ice flow trajectories and can be targeted for cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating. However, understanding how they are transported and deposited is important because this has implications for palaeoglaciological reconstructions and the pre-exposure and/or erosion of the boulders. In this study, we review previous work on EBTs, which indicates that they may form subglacially or supraglacially but that large angular boulders transported long distances generally reflect supraglacial transport. We then report detailed observations of EBTs from Tierra del Fuego, southernmost South America, where their characteristics provide a useful framework for the interpretation of previously published cosmogenic nuclide exposure dates. We present the first comprehensive map of the EBTs and analyse their spatial distribution, size, and physical appearance. Results suggest that they were produced by one or more supraglacial rock avalanches in the Cordillera Darwin and were then transported supraglacially for 100s of kilometres before being deposited. Rock surface weathering analysis shows no significant difference in the weathering characteristics of a sequence of EBTs, previously hypothesized to be of significantly different age (i.e., different glacial cycles). We interpret this to indicate that the EBTs are much closer in age than previous work has implied. This emphasises the importance of understanding EBT formation when using them for cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating.},

Our data show that a cold-based EAIS was present, in a configuration similar to today, for many periods over the last {\textasciitilde}\&thinsp;14.5\&thinsp;Myr, including the mid-Miocene, Late Pliocene, and early-to-mid Pleistocene. Moraine ages at Roberts Massif increase with distance from, and elevation above the modern ice margin, which is consistent with a persistent EAIS extent during glacial maxima, and slow, isostatic uplift of the massif itself in response to trough incision by outlet glaciers. We also employ the exceptionally high cosmogenic-nuclide concentrations in several boulders, along with multi-isotope measurements in sandstone boulders, to infer extremely low erosion rates ({\textless}{\textless}\&thinsp;5\&thinsp;cm/Myr) over the period covered by our record. Although our data are not a direct measure of ice volume, the Roberts Massif glacial record indicates that the EAIS was present and similar to its current configuration during at least some periods when global temperature was believed to be warmer and/or atmospheric CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ concentrations were likely higher than today.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we provide ages for the Río Cullen and San Sebastián glacial limits of the former Bahía Inútil–San Sebastián (BI-SSb) ice lobe on Tierra del Fuego (53–54°S), previously hypothesised to represent advances during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 12 and 10, respectively. Our approach uses cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al exposure dating, but targets glacial outwash associated with these limits and uses depth-profiles and surface cobble samples, thereby accounting for surface deflation and inheritance. The data reveal that the limits formed more recently than previously thought, giving ages of 45.6 ka (+139.9−14.3) for the Río Cullen, and 30.1 ka (+45.6−23.1) for the San Sebastián limits. These dates indicate extensive glaciation in southern Patagonia during MIS 3, prior to the well-constrained, but much less extensive MIS 2 (gLGM) limit. This suggests the pattern of ice advances in the region was different to northern Patagonia, with the terrestrial limits relating to the last glacial cycle, rather than progressively less extensive glaciations over hundreds of thousands of years. However, the dates are consistent with MIS 3 glaciation elsewhere in the southern mid-latitudes, and the combination of cooler summers and warmer winters with increased precipitation, may have caused extensive glaciation prior to the gLGM.},

	abstract = {Abstract Many glacial deposits in the Quartermain Mountains, Antarctica present two apparent contradictions regarding the degradation of unconsolidated deposits. The glacial deposits are up to millions of years old, yet they have maintained their meter-scale morphology despite the fact that bedrock and regolith erosion rates in the Quartermain Mountains have been measured at 0·1?4·0 m Ma?1. Additionally, ground ice persists in some Miocene-aged soils in the Quartermain Mountains even though modeled and measured sublimation rates of ice in Antarctic soils suggest that without any recharge mechanisms ground ice should sublimate in the upper few meters of soil on the order of 103 to 105 years. This paper presents results from using the concentration of cosmogenic nuclides beryllium-10 (10Be) and aluminum-26 (26Al) in bulk sediment samples from depth profiles of three glacial deposits in the Quartermain Mountains. The measured nuclide concentrations are lower than expected for the known ages of the deposits, erosion alone does not always explain these concentrations, and deflation of the tills by the sublimation of ice coupled with erosion of the overlying till can explain some of the nuclide concentration profiles. The degradation rates that best match the data range 0·7?12 m Ma?1 for sublimation of ice with initial debris concentrations ranging 12?45\% and erosion of the overlying till at rates of 0·4?1·2 m Ma?1. Overturning of the tills by cryoturbation, vertical mixing, or soil creep is not indicated by the cosmogenic nuclide profiles, and degradation appears to be limited to within a few centimeters of the surface. Erosion of these tills without vertical mixing may partially explain how some glacial deposits in the Quartermain Mountains maintain their morphology and contain ground ice close to the surface for millions of years.

The end of the Würm Pleniglacial is characterised by a long phase dominated by Poaceae that extended from ca. 20 000 to ca. 15 000 B.P. Another phase with Poaceae, in the context of a treeless environment, is recorded during the late-glacial between the Juniperus optimum (ca. 13 000 B.P.) and the Betula optimum (after ca. 12 500 B.P.). A marked decline in Betula and a rise in Artemisia values suggest a significant cooling of the climate during the Younger Dryas, an event which is now clearly recorded at several sites in southern Europe. The beginning of the Holocene is characterized by the minor role of Pinus and the early arrival of Quercus which achieves an absolute maximum before the arrival of Ulmus and Corylus. A critical assessment of previously published data is made in the light of these new results.},

	abstract = {Glaciers were common across the Mediterranean mountains during the Little Ice Age. In parts of Turkey some glaciers were several kilometres longer than they are today, whilst in the Pyrenees glaciers were up to several hundred metres longer. In the wettest Mediterranean mountains, such as the Dinaric Alps, many small glaciers and perennial snow patches would have been present. Even in driest and most southerly mountains, such as the High Atlas, small glaciers and perennial snowfields were present. This paper examines the evidence from these two contrasting regions (the western and southern Balkans and the High Atlas) and the climatic significance of glaciers in these areas during the Little Ice Age. Particular focus is given on the climatological controls on glacier mass balance in different climatic conditions. Glaciers in cold and dry climates exhibit different sensitivity to regional climate change compared with glaciers in cold and wet climates. In addition, the factors controlling ablation of glaciers in different climatic regimes can differ considerably, especially the relative contributions and effects of melting and sublimation. All Mediterranean mountain glaciers were strongly controlled by local topoclimatic factors. Avalanche-fed glaciers have proven to be the most resilient to climate change and dramatically increased accumulation from avalanching snow explains the surviving glaciers in the Dinaric Alps and the semi-perennial snow fields of the High Atlas. In addition, geology as well as landscape morphology inherited from Pleistocene glaciations plays a role in explaining the patterns of Little Ice Age glacier distribution and especially the patterns of retreat and survival of these glaciers. The resilience of some of the last remaining Mediterranean glaciers, in the face of warming climate, presents a contradiction and comparisons between glaciers gone and those that remain provides important insight into the future of similar glaciers globally.},

	abstract = {Boulder morphology reflects both lithology and climate and is dictated by the combined effects of erosion, transport, and weathering. At present, morphologic information at the boulder scale is underutilized as a recorder of environmental processes, partly because of the lack of a systematic quantitative parameter set for reporting and comparing data sets. We develop such a parameter set, incorporating a range of measures of boulder form and surface texture. We use standard shape metrics measured in the field and fractal and morphometric classification methods borrowed from landscape analysis and applied to laser-scanned molds. The parameter set was pilot tested on three populations of basalt boulders with distinct breakdown histories in the Channeled Scabland, Washington: (1) basalt outcrop talus; (2) flood-transported boulders recently excavated from a quarry; and (3) flood-transported boulders, extensively weathered in situ on the Ephrata Fan surface. Size and shape data were found to distinguish between flood-transported and untransported boulders. Size and edge angles (∼120°) of flood-transported boulders suggest removal by preferential fracturing along preexisting columnar joints, and curvature data indicate rounding relative to outcrop boulders. Surface textural data show that boulders which have been exposed at the surface are significantly rougher than those buried by fan sediments. Past signatures diagnostic of flood transport still persist on surface boulders, despite ongoing overprinting by processes in the present breakdown environment through roughening and fracturing in situ. Further use of this quantitative boulder parameter set at other terrestrial and planetary sites will aid in cataloging and understanding morphologic signatures of environmental processes.},

Above the boulder deposit, on the flanks of the valley, are more recent and generally much smaller (c. 1–3 m) individual boulders that have fallen from the valley‐wall cliff face, presumably from post‐glacial valley‐side unloading. Some of these smaller boulders are seemingly fresh and unweathered while others have been reduced to no more than mounds in the tundra. These boulders must be younger than the larger, lower giant boulder deposit, but are not particularly recent rockfalls as they are partially buried in colluvium. Comparisons of mineralogy and chemistry indicate that the possibility exists that the incompetent, ‘rotten’ rocks, if not considerably older than their competent neighbors, are inherently self‐destructive. They have evidence of increased sulfur content, which is a proxy for pyrite, a known weathering accelerant in Kärkevagge.},

These mica schist and garnet-mica schist boulders apparently have been there since the waning stages of glaciation in the valley, about 13,000 to 9000 years ago according to cosmogenic dating. Boulder elevations range from 665 to 825 m asl, with the higher and possibly younger boulders situated farther up the valley. We used total chemical analyses of rock and incipient soils forming on the boulders to determine relative weathering intensity on the tops of 20 boulders arrayed across lower, middle, and upper valley positions. An additional three boulders from a deposit of giant boulders damming Lake Rissajaure at the valley head were also analyzed. The dam may be a later deposit, as indicated by preliminary cosmogenic dates, or may be part of the larger valley deposit as other interpretations surmise. Total chemistry was not significantly different between the mica schist and garnet-mica schist boulders. However, total chemistry did vary by position. Boulders at the lowest positions were chemically more similar to those at the dam than to the other positions. This difference was removed when calculating the overall weathering indices by taking the ratio of weathering indices of the C horizon to exposed rock. A clear trend in the weathering was revealed by the analyses: lower valley boulders show significantly more weathering than the upper group and the middle group is intermediate. This indicates that weathering rates differ because of elevation or age of the boulders strewn down the valley. However, boulders on the Lake Rissajaure dam complicate those simple interpretations because they show as much weathering evidence as the lower boulders. All of the weathering indices exhibited this same trend. Elevated levels of Fe in the two more weathered positions indicate influence of pyrite, a known weathering accelerant, and undoubtedly the factor controlling boulder weathering in Kärkevagge.},

This provided a relatively uniform sample to determine influential soil-forming factors. Results showed that the soils were shallow, and exhibited minimal horizonation, mostly A over C horizons. Particle size was predominantly coarse sandy loam, with a significant percentage of silt and clay on a number of the boulders. Clay content was higher on the garnet-mica-schist than on the mica-schist boulders. Soil pH was acidic. Deeper soils had developed overlying vertical schistocity, emphasizing the role of microenvironment. Muscovite, chlorite and mixed-layer minerals were the predominant clay minerals in the boulder soils. Secondary clay formation in soils indicated that chemical weathering was occurring.

Disruption of illuvial features by faunal activity and shrink-swell processes in the upper B horizons accentuate apparent illuvial clay maxima in the B3 and C horizons. Low clay contents in the A horizons of the red podzolic soils examined result from ehviation and clay decomposition, whereas the higher fine sand contents of these horizons result, in part, from the deposition of aeolian transported materials. Substantial aeolian deposition at another site has led to the development of a red earth.

	abstract = {Weathering rinds, zones of alteration on the exterior surfaces of rock outcrops and coarse unconsolidated surficial debris are widely used by geomorphologists and Quaternary geologists as indicators of the relative age of landforms and landscapes. Additionally they provide unique insights into the earliest stages of rock and mineral weathering, yet the origin of these alteration zones is relatively poorly understood. This lack of understanding applies especially to the initial stages of rind formation. The study reported in this paper has two principal objectives. The first is to use lightly polished granite discs inserted in soil profiles under several different plant communities in an Arctic alpine environment for a period of four or five years to investigate the nature of incipient weathering rind development. The second is to investigate the factors responsible for spatial variability in the nature and rates of rind formation. Incipient weathering rind development on the outer edges of the granite discs is observable and measurable over a period of time as short as four years in the mild Arctic alpine environment of Swedish Lapland. The earliest stages of rind development involve the development of a porous structure consisting of a combination of pits and fractures which have been solutionally enlarged and modified. Solution appears to be preferentially concentrated on the surfaces of feldspars and, to a lesser extent, quartz. In addition, iron oxides are present along grain boundaries and in grain interiors and are interpreted to have been derived from the oxidation of ferromagnesian minerals. Spatial variability in weathering rind development appears to be particularly driven by differences in moisture but is not related to soil pH. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The timing of glacier disappearance and rock glacier stabilization in the highest massifs of the Carpathians is still poorly documented. In this paper, we establish the extent and chronology of the final stages of glaciation and timing of stabilization of the uppermost rock glaciers in the Tatra Mountains, which are the highest (2654 m a.s.l.), northernmost (N 49°12′), and coldest range in the Carpathians. On the base of morphostratigraphic principles, Schmidt Hammer tests and glacier equilibrium line altitude (ELA) estimation, we assigned moraines and rock glaciers in the Mt. Kriváň massif (SW part of High Tatras) to a threefold stratigraphic sequence with glacial stages/advances from older to younger: Popradské pleso (Pp), Suchá važecká I (Sv I) and Suchá važecká II (Sv II). Landforms attributed to two younger advances, Sv I and Sv II, were sampled for the purpose of cosmogenic 10Be surface exposure dating. Our data show that Pp and Sv I glacial advances occurred during the Oldest Dryas climatic downturn. The younger advance (Sv I) occurred just before the Bølling-Allerød (B/A) warming at 14.9 ± 0.4 ka, at this time small glaciers occupied lower glacial cirques in the study area. The youngest Sv II advance was characterized by rock glaciers and small debris-covered glaciers confined to the highest cirques. The mean exposure age of four relict rock glaciers of this stage is 11.1 ± 0.9 ka but individual rock glacier mean ages spanned between 11.8 and 10.4 ka. Our research results show that the youngest moraines and rock glaciers in the Tatra Mountains were formed during the Younger Dryas (YD), but the final permafrost melting and rock glacier stabilization period was delayed until the early Holocene, but no later than 10.4 ka. In high elevation cirque bottoms (up to 2120 m a.s.l.), the YD glaciers and rock glaciers readvanced across land which was ice-free as early as 14.8–14.2 ka. Thus, it is likely that during the B/A interphase, glaciers completely disappeared in the Tatra Mountains. The YD was the last period of glacial/periglacial activity in the massif. As we investigated one of the highest-situated rock glaciers in the Tatras (up to 2220 m a.s.l.), we conclude that all rock glaciers in this massif are relict landforms which developed in response to severe Lateglacial climate conditions. The Lateglacial climate of the Tatra Mountains is discussed herein on the basis of glacier equilibrium line altitude (ELA) estimation and the vertical distribution of rock glacier belts. We argue that paleoclimate significance of the presented geomorphological record may match paleobotanical proxy reconstructions and the results of climate simulations, but only if the impact of enhanced temperature seasonality on glacier mass balance and rock glacier activity is taken into account.},

	abstract = {In order to assess the potential of the Schmidt hammer for relative-age dating, rebound (R) values were collected from more than 50 sites on two glacier forelands in Jotunheimen, southern Norway. Four factors are found to influence results: instrument errors, lithology, weathering, and boulder-surface roughness. The influence of each is examined and its potential as a source of error assessed. Particular attention is paid to roughness, which may reflect either transport history or the differential weathering of minerals. On Little Ice Age moraines, where differential weathering of minerals is insignificant, variation in R-values parallels variation in boulder-surface roughness, which in turn is related to transport history. Boulder roundness provides a surrogate measure of primary boulder-surface roughness (prior to weathering) and assists in interpreting sites which yield anomalously low R-values. Although the Schmidt hammer has some potential for measuring rock weathering, and thus for interpreting relative age, it should be viewed only as a rapid, inexpensive, and convenient technique for preliminary assessment.},

	abstract = {Glaciers on land leave behind characteristic landforms and bedrock topography. The spatial extent of this signature and dating of the erosional and depositional features has led to a good understanding of temporal and spatial shifts of past glaciers and climate. At best the landscape contains considerable information on past glacial processes in the form of moraines and other depositional landforms. However, evidence suggests that all unconsolidated landforms degrade, manifested in the general degradation and smoothing of the topography over time. To determine the relative amount and pattern of degradation on glacial moraines we use a well-documented moraine degradation model that uses both local slope and a proportionality constant to determine the diamicton transport rate. This formulation results in diffusion type topographic smearing and smoothing of the initially angular topographic features. More specifically, diamicton is eroded at the crest of a moraine, transported downhill, and deposited on the gentler lower flank. Collectively this produces moraine cross-profiles that closely resemble observations in the field. By assuming an initial constant boulder frequency per unit volume of the diamicton, the model tracks the surface lowering and the related exhumation of boulders to the moraine surface. This produces a tightly constrained set of testable predictions: (1) modelled moraine cross-profile; (2) modelled spatial pattern of surface boulders (no boulders on the lower flank); and (3) relative frequency of surface boulders (smallest frequency of surface boulders at the inflection point, highest frequency at the crest). These characteristics were measured in the field of alpine, tropical, and Antarctic moraines. The correspondence between model predictions and field data is remarkably good, and strongly supports our understanding of the time dependent evolution of glacial landscapes. These results highlight the evolving nature of glacial landforms and indicate the complete removal of original moraine surfaces and postglacial emergence of spatial pattern in boulder frequency.},

	abstract = {Glacial boulders and soils on moraines are often dated to quantify the timing of glaciations and/or rates of chemical weathering in moraine chronosequences. A common assumption is that moraine crest erosion and soil mixing are unimportant. However, several studies suggest moraine denudation may be substantial. We evaluate the magnitude of moraine denudation and soil mixing in the Pinedale (∼21 ka) and Bull Lake (∼140 ka) moraines at Fremont Lake (Wyoming, United States) using cosmogenic nuclide depth profiles and a numerical model of moraine erosion and nuclide production and decay. Depth profiles indicate mixing of the surface layer from 40 to 60 cm depth. Age constraints from depth profile dating of cosmogenic nuclides result in ages of 17–24 ka for the Pinedale moraine and 70–127.5 ka for the Bull Lake moraine. These ages are comparable to ages based on the Lal and Chen approach which uses a sample from the mixed layer and the unmixed layer. However, the Lal and Chen approach is difficult to apply in real environments as the mixing depth needs to be determined independently. We find our best fit model based ages for the Bull Lake moraine are younger than independent age constraints from boulder exposure dating due to incomplete mixing. Exposure age constraints from boulders are more straightforward for moraines than ages based on depth profile dating. Finally, we find that moraine crests do significantly erode and are mixed, suggesting that previous weathering and dust accumulation rate studies on moraines provide minimum estimates for these processes.},

The youngest moraines are boulder-rich and sharp-crested, but successively older moraines have lower boulder frequencies and are more degraded. Seventy-six 36Cl dates for the moraines cluster in groups having mean ages (± 1σ) of 12,500 ± 500, 13,300 ± 800, 16,100 ± 1100, 19,100 ± 3000, 70,900 ± 1500, 93,100 ± 2600, and 105,400 ± 2200 years; a still-older, highly weathered and eroded moraine is undated, but likely is at least 165,000 years old. The moraine ages and relative extent of the Icicle Creek glacier correspond closely to the ages and relative amplitude of July insolation minima at 47.5° N latitude. They also are in accord with ages for glaciations in the European Alps that were inferred by Milutin Milankovitch and colleagues in the 1920s based on calculations of summer insolation. Evidence that the greatest Late Pleistocene glacier advance occurred at the onset of the last glaciation (during marine isotope substage 5d) is consistent with a cooling climate and major glacier advances at that time elsewhere in North America and the Eurasian Arctic, with a dramatic increase in global ice volume, and with the shifting track of the jet stream over northwestern United States.},

The inferred glacial chronologies from the various localities all exhibit certain characteristics: (1) Local records are fragmentary and deposits of some glacial advances are always missing; no location has deposits of all glaciations and no glacial advance is recorded at all locations. This is due either to unfavorable conditions for glacier development at some times or to obliteration of earlier deposits by later, more extensive glaciers. (2) Most moraines have young apparent exposure ages, with only a few older than the last glacial cycle. This may be due to young true ages of these deposits, erosion of moraine surfaces, or obliterative overlap and covering of older deposits by younger ones. (3) Many deposits that were previously correlated (e.g., based on their stratigraphic positions) are not correlative; they may represent different stades and, sometimes, even different glaciations. Similarly, some previously uncorrelated deposits have the same exposure ages and may be correlative. (4) Clusters of several distinct moraines of nearly the same age are present at most locations. These clusters suggest that alpine moraines are formed during short deposition episodes that last between several hundred and several thousand years.},

	abstract = {Cosmogenic 36Cl surface exposure ages obtained for multiple boulders from single landforms are usually characterized by a variance larger than that of the analytical methods employed. This excessive boulder-to-boulder variability, progressively more profound with increasing age of landforms, is due to removal of soil and gradual exposure of boulders at the surface. In our gradual exposure model, boulders are initially buried in moraine matrix. With time, erosion lowers the moraine surface and the boulders are gradually exposed to cosmic rays. Because the cosmic ray intensity changes with depth, the boulders are subjected to variable production rates of the cosmogenic 36Cl. Initial depth of boulders and their chemical composition are variable, which results in different amounts of the accumulated cosmogenic 36Cl and thus different apparent ages of boulders. The shape of the resulting distribution of the apparent ages and the coefficient of variation depend on the erosion depth, while the first moment is a function of the true surface age and the erosion depth. These properties of the apparent age distributions permit calculation of the surface age, the erosion depth, and also the average erosion rate. We tested the model calculations using 26 boulders from a late Pleistocene moraine at Bishop Creek, Sierra Nevada, California. The set exhibited a bimodal distribution of the 36Cl surface exposure ages. We interpreted the older mode as the result of gradual exposure and the younger one as the result of surficial processes other than soil removal. The 10 samples that constitute the older mode produced a distribution which closely matches the modeled distribution calculated using an age of 85 kyr and erosion depth of 570 g cm−2. This age is the same as an independent estimate obtained from cation ratio studies, and the calculated erosion depth is very close to the erosion depth of 600 g cm−2 based on a simple analytical model of soil erosion. These results indicate that our statistical model adequately describes effects of soil erosion on accumulation of cosmogenic 36Cl. The approach can be used to simultaneously obtain the true landform age and the erosion rate from apparent 36Cl ages and thereifore may help in evaluation of surface exposure ages of eroding landforms.},

	abstract = {Rock surface erosion by wildfire is significant and widespread but has not been quantified in southern California or for chaparral ecosystems. Quantifying the surface erosion of bedrock outcrops and boulders is critical for determination of age using cosmogenic radionuclide techniques, as even modest surface erosion removes the accumulation of the cosmogenic radionuclides and causes significant underestimate of age. This study documents the effects on three large granitic boulders following the Esperanza Fire of 2006 in southern California. Spalled rock fragments were quantified by measuring the removed rock volume from each measured boulder. Between 7\% and 55\% of the total surface area of the boulders spalled in this single fire. The volume of spalled material, when normalized across the entire surface area, represents a mean surface lowering of 0.7–12.3 mm. Spalled material was thicker on the flanks of the boulders, and the height of the fire effects significantly exceeded the height of the vegetation prior to the wildfire. Surface erosion of boulders and bedrock outcrops as a result of wildfire spalling results in fresh surfaces that appear unaffected by chemical weathering. Such surfaces may be preferentially selected by researchers for cosmogenic surface dating because of their fresh appearance, leading to an underestimate of age.},

	abstract = {Northeastern Germany was repeatedly covered by the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the last glaciation and a succession of distinct ice marginal belts is present in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. We used surface exposure dating to develop a time frame for the retreat of the ice margin. Two samples from the Saalian ice marginal belt give Weichselian ages, a problem that has also been encountered further south when attempting to date the same ice marginal belt (the Hoher Fläming) in Brandenburg. One sample from the Frankfurt moraine is too young to be associated with this glacial feature. Another single sample from the Velgast extent gives also an exposure age that is too young to be associated with this glacial feature. These two examples highlight the necessity to sample multiple boulders on the same feature to obtain a reliable exposure age. Fourteen samples were collected on the Pomeranian moraine and 12 were used to calculate an average deposition time of 15.6 ± 0.6 10Be kyr. Two samples were removed from the age distribution based on statistical grounds. This result is in good agreement with results obtained in Brandenburg where the Pomeranian moraine was dated at 16.4 ± 0.7 10Be kyr. Five samples from the Mecklenburgian moraine give an average age of 13.7 ± 0.6 10Be kyr in good chronological order with the Pomeranian moraine age. One sample (MVP-21) from the Mecklenburgian moraine was corrected for burial effect based on historical documents demonstrating that if known, the recent past history of exposure of a surface can be appropriately used to calculate an exposure age. Together, this new data set highlights: 1. the difficulty to date surfaces older than the Weichselian glaciation when using only one cosmogenic radionuclide, 2. the consistency of the results obtained for the Pomeranian moraine across northeastern Germany using cosmogenic Be-10.},

At the Early Lateglacial Gschnitz site (Trins, Austria), a 3000yr spread in 10Be exposure ages points to prolonged boulder instability. Three out of seven ages are not included in the mean age calculation, which yielded 15,400±1000yr (indistinguishable from the oldest boulder age of 16,130±1040yr). As a result of the distinctive morphology at Julier Pass (Switzerland) site we are able to exposure date the early (12,300±1300yr) and the late (11,300±600yr) Egesen stadial glacier advances (Younger Dryas equivalent), not just final retreat. At the Kromer site (Austria), 10Be exposure ages from five clast-supported boulders are indistinguishable within the analytical uncertainties (mean age: 8400±500yr). In addition to moraine age, key factors that may lead to “too young” ages include degree of matrix- vs. clast-support of the boulders, post-depositional periglacial activity and tree coverage. At the Nägelisgrätli bedrock site near Grimsel Pass (Switzerland) exposure ages of 10,760–11,720yr are consistent with Early Holocene cirque glacier retreat, and underline the marked lack of nuclide inheritance in bedrock exposures in the Alps.},

	abstract = {An accurate review of the literature on surface exposure dating methods shows evidence of the difficulty in applying cosmogenic dating methods to old moraines because of the intensity of late Quaternary erosion processes. Moreover, as in some previous cases, we also found special difficulties in applying these methods to LIA moraines, caused by the intensity of current paraglacial processes. The objective of this study is to apply cosmogenic dating methods to very old and very young moraines, which in both cases have been or are being affected intensively by erosion. With this purpose, we collected samples of boulders from moraines corresponding to (i) the penultimate glaciation and (ii) the Little Ice Age (LIA), both from Sierra Nevada in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. The sampling strategy was based on a preliminary accurate analysis of the geomorphological settings of two valley sites that resulted in the collection of only four boulder samples from an old moraine and three more from a very recent moraine. Using in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be to date these boulders, the old samples yielded an age of ca. 130–135ka for moraine stabilization. The younger samples indicate that the LIA moraine accretion probably occurred between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, with a subsequent stage of accumulation during the nineteenth century as suggested by historical documents. Dating a glaciation that occurred prior to the last Pleistocene glacial cycle and dating LIA glacial stages are novel in the context of Iberian glaciations and agree with other palaeoenvironmental studies in Iberian and in other European mountains. The limited number of boulders adequate for cosmic-ray exposure dating prevents statistical methods to be applied, and therefore highlights the need to improve geomorphological criteria in sample selection.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Geomorphic process modeling allows us to evaluate different methods for estimating moraine ages from cosmogenic exposure dates, and may provide a means to identify the processes responsible for the excess scatter among exposure dates on individual moraines. Cosmogenic exposure dating is an elegant method for estimating the ages of moraines, but individual exposure dates are sometimes biased by geomorphic processes. Because exposure dates may be either "too young" or "too old," there are a variety of methods for estimating the ages of moraines from exposure dates. In this paper, we present Monte Carlo-based models of moraine degradation and inheritance of cosmogenic nuclides, and we use the models to examine the effectiveness of these methods. The models estimate the statistical distributions of exposure dates that we would expect to obtain from single moraines, given reasonable geomorphic assumptions. The model of moraine degradation is based on prior examples, but the inheritance model is novel. The statistical distributions of exposure dates from the moraine degradation model are skewed toward young values; in contrast, the statistical distributions of exposure dates from the inheritance model are skewed toward old values. Sensitivity analysis shows that this difference is robust for reasonable parameter choices. Thus, the skewness can help indicate whether a particular data set has problems with inheritance or moraine degradation. Given representative distributions from these two models, we can determine which methods of estimating moraine ages are most successful in recovering the correct age for test cases where this value is known. The mean is a poor estimator of moraine age for data sets drawn from skewed parent distributions, and excluding outliers before calculating the mean does not improve this mismatch. The extreme estimators (youngest date and oldest date) perform well under specific circumstances, but fail in other cases. We suggest a simple estimator that uses the skewnesses of individual data sets to determine whether the youngest date, mean, or oldest date will provide the best estimate of moraine age. Although this method is perhaps the most globally robust of the estimators we tested, it sometimes fails spectacularly. The failure of simple methods to provide accurate estimates of moraine age points toward a need for more sophisticated statistical treatments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {1) Three indices of global climate have been monitored in the record of the past 450,000 years in Southern Hemisphere ocean-floor sediments.
2) Over the frequency range 10–4 to 10–5 cycle per year, climatic variance of these records is concentrated in three discrete spectral peaks at periods of 23,000, 42,000, and approximately 100,000 years. These peaks correspond to the dominant periods of the earth's solar orbit, and contain respectively about 10, 25, and 50 percent of the climatic variance.
3) The 42,000-year climatic component has the same period as variations in the obliquity of the earth's axis and retains a constant phase relationship with it.
4) The 23,000-year portion of the variance displays the same periods (about 23,000 and 19,000 years) as the quasi-periodic precession index.
5) The dominant, 100,000-year climatic
[See table in the PDF file]
component has an average period close to, and is in phase with, orbital eccentricity. Unlike the correlations between climate and the higher-frequency orbital variations (which can be explained on the assumption that the climate system responds linearly to orbital forcing), an explanation of the correlation between climate and eccentricity probably requires an assumption of nonlinearity.
6) It is concluded that changes in the earth's orbital geometry are the fundamental cause of the succession of Quaternary ice ages.
7) A model of future climate based on the observed orbital-climate relationships, but ignoring anthropogenic effects, predicts that the long-term trend over the next sevem thousand years is toward extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation.},

	abstract = {Understanding and interpretation of ‘numbers’ produced about the depositional age of an erratic boulder by cosmogenic nuclide surface-exposure dating is important in the construction of glacial chronology. We have sampled three ‘Findlinge’ (glacially transported boulders) located on the right-lateral margin of the Aare glacier at Möschberg, Grosshöchstetten, southeast of Bern, with the aim of shedding light on this topic. The boulders have the same depositional, but different post-depositional histories: simple exposure; exhumation; and human impact. This sampling is specially selected for this study, since the boulders showing exhumation and human impact would not have been sampled in a regular surface-exposure dating application. We measured cosmogenic 10Be concentrations and calculated apparent exposure ages that are 13.6 ± 0.5, 18.1 ± 0.8, and 7.5 ± 0.4 ka, respectively. The exposure age of the first boulder reflects exhumation. The apparent exposure age of 18.1 ± 0.8 ka (erosion-corrected exposure age 19.0 ± 0.9 ka) from the second boulder correlates well with the end of the Alpine and global last glacial maximum. The third boulder shows evidence of quarrying as it is surrounded by a rim of excavation material, which is also reflected by the 7.5 ± 0.4 ka apparent exposure age. We modeled the variation of 10Be concentrations with depth down into the sediment in which the first (exhumed) boulder was once buried in, and down into the third (quarried) boulder. According to our modeling, we determined that the exhumed ‘Findling’ was buried in sediment at a depth of around 0.5 m, and around 2 m of rock was quarried from the third ‘Findling’. Our results reveal the importance of sampling for surface-exposure dating within a well defined field context, as post-depositional impacts can easily hinder exposure-dating of surfaces.},

Seven of these surfaces had previously been dated using terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure-age dating. Application of the granite calibration equation of Tomkins et al. (2018c) indicated a close correspondence between the SHD ages and the TCN ages (within 1σ or 2σ uncertainties). These findings demonstrate that SHD ages can be of comparable accuracy, precision, and reliability to TCN ages and are a strong argument for the more extensive use of SHD in some Quaternary dating projects. However, surface ages obtained by both SHD and TCN dating should not be accepted uncritically; they must be assessed in relation to the wider geological, geomorphological, and geochronological evidence. Evaluation of eight SHD ages, for which corresponding TCN ages are not available, indicate that most are consistent with current theory and field evidence, but some anomalous age estimates occur.},

	abstract = {Although there has been a surge of interest in density estimation in recent years, much of the published research has been concerned with purely technical matters with insufficient emphasis given to the technique's practical value. Furthermore, the subject has been rather inaccessible to the general statistician.The account presented in this book places emphasis on topics of methodological importance, in the hope that this will facilitate broader practical application of density estimation and also encourage research into relevant theoretical work. The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those with general interests in statistics. The important role of density estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text.Several contexts in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting, projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method, both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods, which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution, and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.},

	abstract = {Cosmogenic exposure dating has greatly enhanced our ability to define glacial chronologies spanning several global cold periods, and glacial boulder exposure ages are now routinely used to constrain deglaciation ages. However, exposure dating involves assumptions about the geological history of the sample that are difficult to test and yet may have a profound effect on the inferred age. Two principal geological factors yield erroneous inferred ages: exposure prior to glaciation (yielding exposure ages that are too old) and incomplete exposure due to post-depositional shielding (yielding exposure ages that are too young). Here we show that incomplete exposure is more important than prior exposure, using datasets of glacial boulder 10Be exposure ages from the Tibetan Plateau (1420 boulders), Northern Hemisphere palaeo-ice sheets (631 boulders), and present-day glaciers (208 boulders). No boulders from present-day glaciers and few boulders from the palaeo-ice sheets have exposure ages significantly older than independently known deglaciation ages, indicating that prior exposure is of limited significance. Further, while a simple post-depositional landform degradation model can predict the exposure age distribution of boulders from the Tibetan Plateau, a prior exposure model fails, indicating that incomplete exposure is important. The large global dataset demonstrates that, in the absence of other evidence, glacial boulder exposure ages should be viewed as minimum limiting deglaciation ages.},

	abstract = {Cosmogenic exposure dating of glacial boulders is commonly used to estimate the timing of past glaciations because the method enables direct dating of the duration a boulder has been exposed to cosmic rays. For successful dating, the boulders must have been fully shielded from cosmic rays prior to deposition and continuously exposed to cosmic rays ever since. A common assumption is that boulder height (the distance between the top of the boulder and the surrounding surface) is important, and that tall boulders are more likely to have been continuously exposed to cosmic rays than short boulders and therefore yield more accurate exposure ages. Here we test this assumption based on exposure age clustering for groups of glacial boulders (and single cobbles) 10Be exposure ages that have recorded boulder heights (3741 boulders; 579 boulder groups with ≥3 boulders). Of the full set of boulder groups with ≥3 boulders, 21\% fulfill a reduced chi square criterion (χR2{\textless}2) for well-clustered exposure ages. For boulder groups containing only tall boulders, the fraction of well-clustered exposure age groups is consistently larger. Moreover, this fraction of well-clustered exposure age groups increases with the minimum boulder height in each group. This result confirms the common assumption that tall boulders are generally better targets for cosmogenic exposure dating compared to short boulders. Whereas the tall boulder groups have a significantly larger fraction of well-clustered exposure age groups, there is nonetheless a dominant fraction ({\textgreater}50\%) of the boulder groups with scattered exposure ages, highlighting the problem with prior and incomplete exposure for cosmogenic dating of glacial boulders.},

In the Nenana River valley, glaciation occurred at 104–180 ka (Lignite Creek glaciation), ca. 55 ka (Healy glaciation), and ca. 16 ka (Carlo Creek phase); glaciers retreated in the Reindeer Hills and Monahan Flat by ca. 14 ka and ca. 13 ka, respectively. The Carlo Creek moraine is similar in age to at least six other moraines in the Alaska Range, Ahklun Mountains and Brooks Range. The new data suggest that post-depositional geological processes limit the usefulness of 10Be methods to the latter part (≤60 ka) of the late Quaternary in central Alaska. Ages on Healy and younger landforms cluster well, with the exception of Riley Creek moraines and Monahan Flat-west sites, where boulders were likely affected by post-depositional processes.

Examining the scatter helps reveal the long-term lowering of Slessor Glacier, an outlet glacier of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) which flows into the Weddell Sea embayment. 144 26Al and 10Be exposure ages from 72 samples are related to bedrock or clast sample characteristics and geomorphological measures of weathering, slope and stability. We explore this noisy dataset by using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns in the data. Despite noise, there exist correlations between age and degree of weathering and age and elevation above the adjacent ice surface. Clasts with young exposure ages have more complex exposure histories than those with old exposure ages. In terms of glacial history we show that (a) warm-based ice covered the upper slopes of the Shackleton Range millions of years ago and that the uplands have been mainly free of ice for more than 800 ka, (b) that Slessor Glacier's surface elevation was c. 150 m above present at c. 270 ka and c. 700 ka.},

	abstract = {One of the major goals of geomorphology is to understand the rate of landscape evolution and the constraints that erosion sets on the longevity of land surfaces. The latter has also turned out to be vital in modern applications of cosmogenic exposure dating and interpretation of lichenometric data from unconsolidated landforms. Because the effects of landform degradation have not been well documented, disagreements exist among researchers regarding the importance of degradation processes in the dating techniques applied to exposures. Here, we show that all existing qualitative data and quantitative markers of landform degradation collectively suggest considerable lowering of the surface of unconsolidated landforms over the typical life span of Quaternary moraines or fault scarps. Degradation is ubiquitous and considerable even on short time scales of hundreds of years on steeply sloping landforms. These conservative analyses are based entirely on field observations of decreasing slope angles of landforms over the typical range of ages in western North America and widely accepted modeling of landscape degradation. We found that the maximum depth of erosion on fault scarps and moraines is on average 34\% of the initial height of the scarp and 25\% of the final height of the moraine. Although our observations are limited to fault scarps and moraines, the results apply to any sloping unconsolidated landform in the western North America. These results invalidate the prevailing assumption of no or little surface lowering on sloping unconsolidated landforms over the Quaternary Period and affirm that accurate interpretations of lichen ages and cosmogenically dated boulder ages require keen understanding of the ever-present erosion. In our view, the most important results are twofold: 1) to show with a large data set that degradation affects universally all sloping unconsolidated landforms, and 2) to unambiguously show that even conservative estimates of the total lowering of the surface operate at time and depth scales that significantly interfere with cosmogenic exposure and lichen dating.},

This range conflicts with the common assumption that ages of surface boulders are the same as the age of the landform. The wide spread in boulder ages is caused by erosion of the moraine surface and consequent exhumation of fresh boulders. A diffusion model of surface degradation explains the age range and shows that a randomly sampled small set of boulders (n = 3–7) will always yield a lower age limit for the moraine. The model indicates that for identical dating accuracy, six to seven boulders are needed from old and tall moraines (40,000–100,000 yr, 50–100 m initial height) but only one to four boulders from small moraines (20,000–100,000 yr, 10–20 m). By following these guidelines the oldest obtained boulder age will be ≥90\% of the moraine age (95\% probability). This result is only weakly sensitive to a broad range of soil erosion rates. Our analysis of published boulder ages indicates that {\textless}3\% of all moraine boulders have prior exposure, and 85\% of these boulders predate the dated moraine.},

Glacial landforms in central Garwhal are present only within a few kilometers of the present glaciers and all date to less than ∼12.5 ka. This suggests that the Lateglacial and/or Holocene glacial advances were more extensive than their predecessors and hence destroyed or buried evidence for earlier glaciation or that other processes, such as intensive fluvial erosion and/or hillslope mass movements, have destroyed evidence of earlier glaciation. Prominent laterofrontal moraines date to the Lateglacial, the Early Holocene, and the Neoglaciation. Moraines next to the active ice and boulders on contemporary glaciers date to 101–102 years before present. This suggests only a minor glacial advance during the Little Ice Age occurred in central Garhwal. These young ages indicate that inheritance of TCNs in areas that were recently glaciated is very small and likely has little effect when considering TCN ages on moraines older than the global Last Glacial Maximum. The new 10Be ages are combined with 1081 recalculated 10Be ages from previous studies to develop a regional framework of glaciation across the monsoon-influenced and adjacent regions of the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen. We separate what appears to be continuous glaciation into 27 regional glacial stages (plus 2 tentative glacial stages) that are termed monsoonal Himalayan–Tibetan stages (MOHITS). The regional glacial stages cover a wide chronologic range that includes: five regional glacial stages older than the Last Glacial cycle (MOHITS 13 at 483 ± 38 ka to MOHITS 5E at 122 ± 15 ka); thirteen regional glacial stages within the Last Glacial cycle (MOHITS 5B at 91 ± 15 ka to MOHITS 2A at 12.9 ± 0.9 ka); and eleven regional glacial stages during the Holocene (MOHITS 1k at 11.4 ± 0.7 ka to MOHITS 1A at 0.4 ± 0.1 ka). There are strong correlations both with periods of strong monsoons, and northern hemisphere events throughout the entire chronologic range with 16 stages linked to the monsoon, 11 stages linked to the mid-latitude westerlies, and two unassigned because of large age uncertainties. Overall, we see a complex pattern of glaciation influenced by two climatic systems throughout the mid/late Quaternary.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} In the last decades surface exposure dating using cosmogenic nuclides has emerged as a powerful tool in Quaternary geochronology and landscape evolution studies. Cosmogenic nuclides are produced in rocks and sediment due to reactions induced by cosmic rays. Landforms ranging in age from a few hundred years to tens of millions of years can be dated (depending on rock or landform weathering rates) by measuring nuclide concentrations. In this paper the history and theory of surface exposure dating are reviewed followed by an extensive outline of the fields of application of the method. Sampling strategies as well as information on individual nuclides are discussed in detail. The power of cosmogenic nuclide methods lies in the number of nuclides available (the radionuclides 10Be, 14C, 26Al, and 36Cl and the stable noble gases 3He and 21Ne), which allows almost every mineral and hence almost every lithology to be analyzed. As a result focus can shift to the geomorphic questions. It is important that obtained exposure ages are carefully scrutinized in the framework of detailed field studies, including local terrace or moraine stratigraphy and regional morphostratigraphic relationships; as well as in light of independent age constraints.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Analysis of aerial photographs, GPS mapping and comparison of digital elevation models have been used to quantify the losses in extent and volume observed (1981–2005) in the glaciers of the Maladeta massif (Spanish Pyrenees). The data are examined in relation to different climatic (temperature, precipitation) and topographic factors that control glacial retreat both at the general and local scales. The evolution observed in the massif is characterized by the remarkable surface and volumetric shrinkage registered in all the glaciers: (1) glacial ice decreased in extent 35.7\%, reducing from 240.9 ha to 155.0 ha; (2) losses in total ice volume reached 0.0137 km3 (75.6 m w.e.); (3) mean altitude of the studied glaciers increased 43.5 m. These changes seem to have been forced by climatic change (reduction in the snowfall contributions and increase in the maximum temperatures) during the past few decades in this Pyrenean region. In addition, local variables such as the orientation of each glacier, their altitude and their initial size seem to have induced significant spatial differences in the magnitude of the losses.},

	abstract = {A new method was designed and used for determining the half-life of the isotope 10Be. The method is based on (1) accurate 10Be/9Be measurements of 9Be-spiked solutions of a 10Be-rich master solution using multicollector ICP mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) and (2) liquid scintillation counting (LSC) using the CIEMAT/NIST method for determining the activity concentrations of the solutions whose 10Be concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry. Important requirements for the success of this approach (a) was the previous coating of glass ampoules filled for counting experiments with 9Be, thereby reducing the risk of the adsorptive loss of 10Be; (b) the removal of Boron from solutions to be measured by MC-ICP-MS by cation chromatography without the introduction of mass fractionation and (c) the accurate determination of the mass bias of 10Be/9Be measurements by ICP-MS which are always affected by the space-charge effect. The mass bias factor was determined to be 1.1862±0.071 for 10Be/9Be from careful fitting and error propagation of ratios of measured Li, B, Si, Cr, Fe, Cu, Sr, Nd, Hf, Tl and U standard solutions of known composition under the same measurement conditions. Employing this factor, an absolute 10Be/9Be ratio of 1.464±0.014 was determined for a first dilution of the 10Be-rich master solution. This solution is now available as an absolute Be ratio standard in AMS measurements. Finally, a half-life of (1.386±0.016) My (standard uncertainty) was calculated. This value is much more precise than previous estimates and was derived from a fully independent set of experiments. In a parallel, fully independent study using the same master solution, Korschinek et al. [35] have determined a half-life of (1.388±0.018) My. The combined half-life and uncertainty amounts to (1.387±0.012) My. We suggest the use of this value in nuclear studies and in studies that make use of cosmogenic 10Be in environmental and geologic samples.},

	abstract = {The importance of 10Be in different applications of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is well-known. In this context the half-life of 10Be has a crucial impact, and an accurate and precise determination of the half-life is a prerequisite for many of the applications of 10Be in cosmic-ray and earth science research. Recently, the value of the 10Be half-life has been the centre of much debate. In order to overcome uncertainties inherent in previous determinations, we introduced a new method of high accuracy and precision. An aliquot of our highly enriched 10Be master solution was serially diluted with increasing well-known masses of 9Be. We then determined the initial 10Be concentration by least square fit to the series of measurements of the resultant 10Be/9Be ratio. In order to minimize uncertainties because of mass bias which plague other low-energy mass spectrometric methods, we used for the first time Heavy-Ion Elastic Recoil Detection (HI-ERD) for the determination of the 10Be/9Be isotopic ratios, a technique which does not suffer from difficult to control mass fractionation. The specific activity of the master solution was measured by means of accurate liquid scintillation counting (LSC). The resultant combination of the 10Be concentration and activity yields a 10Be half-life of T1/2=1.388±0.018 (1s, 1.30\%) Ma. In a parallel but independent study (Chmeleff et al. [11]), found a value of 1.386±0.016 (1.15\%) Ma. Our recommended weighted mean and mean standard error for the new value for 10Be half-life based on these two independent measurements is 1.387±0.012 (0.87\%) Ma.},

Published procedures have been adapted to our requirements and improved upon where necessary. In particular, new methods to isolate Be with reproducible, high recoveries in the presence of excess Al and Ti were achieved. An existing elution scheme for a cation exchange column procedure was modified to incorporate the use of a 0.25 M H2SO4+0.015\%H2O2 washing step to elute the Ti peroxide complex formed. Problems with dust contamination in ice contributing to measured 10Be signals are also addressed and a procedure developed for its removal.},
